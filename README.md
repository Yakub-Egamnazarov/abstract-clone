# ![Abstract Logo](./src/assets/favicon.png) ABSTRACT website clone by react app.

[Abstract Website](https://www.abstract.com/)

## Technologies used to create the website.

- React App
- SAAS

## BUG

## TODO

---

## Steps I took to make this website:

1. Set up a react app and cleared all the unnecessary tags and stylings
2. Installed SASS library to web dev dependency
3. Favicons and logos changed from react typical pictures to Abstract's. As well as the Title of the project.
4. Hero Section together with navbar at the main PAGE.

Importing svg elements into the react app is easier through react component

```js
import { ReactComponent as Lodo } from "paht";
```
